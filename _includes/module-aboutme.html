<div class="aboutme"><p>I am a Part 1 graduate of Architecture hailing from the Peak District in England. I recently moved to Berlin to complete some research for my thesis project on the city, and I liked it so much here that I decided to stay!</p><p>In terms of the built environment I am driven by design that is aware of its context in place but also in society; design that can be used as a tool of civic creation, engagement and participation. My recent research in Berlin and Northern England, has led me down a path of grass-roots projects that seek to progressively re-use existing spaces for communal gain. This is the kind of architecture that excites me and as I familiarize myself with Berlin, I hope to get more involved with some of these projects.</p><br/><h4>Contact</h4><p><mark>I am currently looking for projects in Berlin to get involved with, if you're in the know please get in touch.</mark></p><p><a class="textlink-dark" href="mailto:info@eandrew.xyz">email: info@eandrew.xyz</a></p><p>phone: +49 176 77966 871</p><div class="media-links"><a class="icon" href="http://dribbble.com/elliottandrew" title="dribbble"><object data="/assets/imgs/icons/dribbble.svg"></object></a><a class="icon" href="http://twitter.com/elliottcandrew" title="twitter"><object data="/assets/imgs/icons/twitter.svg"></object></a><a class="icon" href="http://de.linkedin.com/in/elliottcandrew" title="linkedin"><object data="/assets/imgs/icons/linkedin.svg"></object></a><a class="icon" href="http://elliottandrew.tumblr.com/" title="tumblr"><object data="/assets/imgs/icons/tumblr.svg"></object></a></div><!--img(src="/assets/imgs/personal01.png")--><a href="/photography"><div class="pcard-photos"><div class="pcard-title"><span><div class="t1">Photography</div></span></div></div></a></div>
