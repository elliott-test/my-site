  <strong>A social framework</strong>
  <br><br>
  This project is about making space for people—people making space—and it making them. The notion of creating an environment that is defined by activity, and activity that occurs as a result of its environment. This project is an ecosystem of social involvement, it intersects local community with the transient intrigue of tourism, whilst developing an ever-changing collaborative spectacle that belongs to both. The scheme is underscored by it’s capacity for change, it embraces social diversity and it provides an adaptive forum for this diversity to be celebrated.

  Scarborough is a coastal town that has been popular with northern holiday makers for some decades. It has taken a number of guises over the last few centuries, though as a holiday destination it has seen better days, Scarborough was once a famous spa town; a busy fishing port with prosperous ship building industry, and of course a thriving seaside resort up until the mid 21st Century. The future of Scarborough however is decidedly less certain. Walking down the towns seafront promenade highlights just how much things have change since its heyday of buzzing arcades and busy spas. -->
