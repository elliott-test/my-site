  <strong>An open-source community and enterprise space in Hunslet</strong>
<br>
<br>
  Sitting on the banks of the Leeds-Liverpool Canal, the workshop is a civic venue for design and fabrication, providing affordable facilities, workspaces, tools and advance machinery for all to use. The project gives life to the waterside strip of industry that has historically isolated neighbouring communities from Leeds city centre and, more recently become host to the creeping gentrification of the riverside housing developments.
<br>
<br>
  The Freespace Project aims to empower people to take ownership and responsibility for disused spaces in their local area. Inhabiting these vacant sites allows life to flourish in new use and activity, people and social circles that start to overlap as a resilt. By creating a space that is open and accessible to all, where invention is encouraged and skills developed, community as a whole benefits. The cycle of positive change, informed by new found autonomy, interdependence and communal resillience allows infdividuals access to the otherwise prohibitive, big-money process of urbanisation.

<em>Space should be free for everyone</em>
