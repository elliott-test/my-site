When the weather is good the site plays host to hoardes of cyclists, skaters, tourists and revellers alike. As you would expect, the old airfield is completely flat with most of the 300 hectares covered in open grass. <!--more--> Narrow gravel and tarmac paths criss-cross the expanse, while two parallel runways are the lasting scars of its previous life. The Barbecue area is equally well-used, if not more so, on sunny days smoke rises above the crowds along with the music and conversation from every corner. Offensively loud music pumps from a mobile speaker unit being wheeled around the park by a group of tipsy, sunburnt thirty-something men. Groups of teenagers gather and disipate as quickly as they arrived; there is a changing rythmn of movement, a collective *eb-and-flow* that is as unpredictable as the future of the park itself.
