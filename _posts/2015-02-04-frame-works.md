This project is about making space for people—people making space—and it making them. The notion of creating an environment that is defined by activity, and activity that occurs as a result of its environment. This project is an ecosystem of social involvement, it intersects local community with the transient intrigue of tourism, whilst developing an ever-changing collaborative spectacle that belongs to both. The scheme is underscored by it’s capacity for change, it embraces social diversity and it provides an adaptive forum for this diversity to be celebrated.
