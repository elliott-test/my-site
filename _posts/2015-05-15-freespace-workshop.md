  Sitting on the banks of the Leeds-Liverpool Canal, the workshop is a civic venue for design and fabrication, providing affordable facilities, workspaces, tools and advance machinery for all to use. The project gives life to the waterside strip of industry that has historically isolated neighbouring communities from Leeds city centre and, more recently become host to the creeping gentrification of the riverside housing developments.
