.aboutme

  p I am a Part 1 graduate of Architecture hailing from the Peak District in England. I recently moved to Berlin to complete some research for my thesis project on the city, and I liked it so much here that I decided to stay!
  p In terms of the built environment I am driven by design that is aware of its context in place but also in society; design that can be used as a tool of civic creation, engagement and participation. My recent research in Berlin and Northern England, has led me down a path of grass-roots projects that seek to progressively re-use existing spaces for communal gain. This is the kind of architecture that excites me and as I familiarize myself with Berlin, I hope to get more involved with some of these projects.
