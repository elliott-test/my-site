          p I am a Part 1 graduate of Architecture hailing from Sheffield, in England. I recently moved to Berlin to complete some research for my thesis project on the city, and I liked it so much here that I decided to stay.
          p When it comes to the built environment, I am driven by design that is aware of its context in place but also in society, design as a tool of civic creation, engagement and participation. My recent research in Berlin and Northern England, has led me down a path of grass-roots projects that seek to progressively re-use existing spaces for communal gain. This is the kind of architecture that excites me and as I familiarize myself with Berlin, I hope to get more involved with some of these projects.
          p I'm still working on this website but please take a look around and get in touch if you see anything you like, or of course if you are involved interesting projects in Berlin or beyond please get in touch.
