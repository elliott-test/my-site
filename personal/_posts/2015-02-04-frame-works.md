This project is an ecosystem of social involvement, it intersects local community with the transient intrigue of tourism, whilst developing an ever-changing collaborative spectacle that belongs to both. The scheme is underscored by itâ€™s capacity for change, it embraces social diversity and it provides an adaptive forum for this diversity to be celebrated.
